# HSA12  22. Database: Sharding

## Horizontal Sharding
- Create 3 docker containers: postgresql-b, postgresql-b1, postgresql-b2
- Setup horizontal/vertical sharding as it’s described in this lesson and with alternative tool (citus, pgpool-|| postgres-xl)
- Insert 1 000 000 rows into books.
- Measure performance for reads and writes.
- Do the same without sharding.
- Compare performance of 3 cases (without sharding, FDW, and approach of your choice).
